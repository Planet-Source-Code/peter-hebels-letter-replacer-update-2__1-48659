### Description

According to research at an english university, it doesn't matter in what order the letters in a word are, the only important thing is that the first and last letter is at the right place. The rest can be a total mess and you can still read it without problem. This is because we do not read every letter by it self but the word as a whole.

This 'never seen before' code can make such words for you, it saves the first and last letter and makes a 'total mess' of the middle ones!

Update includes: Now the program is faster and the code is easier to read, this because it is more compact now.

Thanks to Roger Gilchrist for sending me this optimalizations! (NOTE: there is a project like this submitted a while after I submitted mine. That code is not a rip, it works totaly diffrent then this one does)
